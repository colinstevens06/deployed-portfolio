## ReactJS Portfolio
I developed my portfolio using ReactJS. I am a full-stack developer based out of Baltimore. Interested in working with me? Hit me up!

## ReactJS
I used React Components for the whole layout.

I utilize ES6 mapping on the projects page, pulling data from a  JSON file and using a React Component to dynamically generate a card for each project.

## Home Page
This was a lot of fun to do. I wanted to use animations on my homepage. I found a YouTube channel - Dev Ed - and used a lot of his methods in my homepage. I used my own image for the hero image.

I wanted a strong hero image that spoke to Baltimore. I also wanted to keep the design simple and clean. I think the landing section does exactly what I want it to do, catching your eye with an iconic Baltimore image and an animation.

Lower on the page, I use a simple icon-based three-pack, linking to relevant content. I like my animation that makes it fly in from the side.

Then my professional bio at the bottom, I like how it flies in from the bottom, giving it a subtle effect.

One thing I would upgrade in the future: I want that animation on the home page to only run once (maybe once per day?), then I want it to revert to standard transition between pages.

## Projects
I use ES6 mapping on a JSON file to produce the cards dynamically.

## About
Another design case where I wanted a large hero image doing the talking. I took this image of myself while on a hike at the beggining of summer. It's near Hagerstown Maryland. It was about 1.5-mile hike here, I had never been before, but I know it was a great lookout. Taking selfies w/ my Sony Alpha6500 is hard - I can't use autofocus because I'm still behind the camera during focus. Then I press and timer and get in position. This photo was pretty much the most in focus - and the last time I took a portrait-style photo of myself - so I used this one.

I think the overlay on the image could be better. Not in love with it and will look up videos on how to perfect this.

I also think the layout of the body copy could be improved.

I am happy with the simplicity and the way I used a different background color and still maintained readability with my background color and font color.
